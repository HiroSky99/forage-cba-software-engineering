# Interview Tip

> In a typical interview you’ll be asked “why are you interested in this role?” or “why are you interested in working at our company?”. Use this interview tip to explain why you want the job.

**“Why are you interested in this role?”**

I recently participated in Commonwealth Bank's job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate on a Software Engineering team at Commonwealth Bank.

I worked on a project to build and secure a website that provides financial cybersecurity tips for bank clients. I practiced using HTML, CSS, and security best practices, and built my web development and cybersecurity skills in a real-world context.

Doing this program confirmed that I really enjoy working on enhancing user security and designing accessible, secure web solutions, and I'm excited to apply these skills on a Software Engineering team at a company like Commonwealth Bank.
