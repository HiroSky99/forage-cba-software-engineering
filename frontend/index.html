    <h1>Tips for Financial Cybersecurity</h1>

    <h2>1. Use Strong, Unique Passwords</h2>
    <p>
      Using complex and unique passwords for each of your financial accounts is
      a critical first step in protecting your information. Avoid common words
      or easily guessed combinations like “123456” or your birthdate. Consider
      using a password manager to store and generate secure passwords for all
      your accounts.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h2>
    <p>
      Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security beyond just your
      password. With 2FA, even if someone gets your password, they still can’t
      access your account without the second verification step, such as a
      one-time code sent to your phone or email.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Monitor Your Accounts Regularly</h2>
    <p>
      Frequently checking your bank and credit accounts helps you detect any
      suspicious activity early. Look for unfamiliar transactions and report
      them to your bank immediately. Many banks also allow you to set up
      transaction alerts via email or text.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Be Wary of Phishing Scams</h2>
    <p>
      Phishing emails or text messages often look like they come from your bank
      but are designed to trick you into revealing sensitive information. Never
      click on links or open attachments from unknown senders. Instead, go
      directly to your bank’s official website or contact them by phone to
      verify any request.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Keep Your Devices Secure and Up to Date</h2>
    <p>
      Make sure your phone, tablet, and computer have the latest security
      updates installed. Use reputable antivirus and anti-malware software. A
      device that isn’t secure can be an easy entry point for cybercriminals to
      access your financial data.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Avoid Using Public Wi-Fi for Banking</h2>
    <p>
      Public Wi-Fi networks, like those in cafes or airports, are often
      unencrypted and unsafe for sensitive activities like online banking. If
      you must access your bank account while away from home, use a trusted
      mobile network or a virtual private network (VPN).
    </p>

    <h2>7. Log Out After Banking Sessions</h2>
    <p>
      Always log out from your online banking session when you’re finished,
      especially when using shared or public devices. This simple step can
      prevent unauthorized users from accessing your information.
